Sadly, many organizations think that a web application vulnerability scanner will provide reliable data on their systems.

Hackerone and Bugcrowd are two popular platforms for bug hunting. In this course you'll learn how to start hacking and making money at those sites. There are many companies (Twitter, Uber, Yahoo, Facebook, Dell,Snapchat etc.) that allow you to legally hack their services, and you can get paid for it.
